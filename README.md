# Overview
Welcome to the Daikibo Telemetry Live Dashboard project! This repository is part of the Deloitte Technology Virtual Internship Program and contains the source code and documentation for a private dashboard designed to monitor the health status of machines across Daikibo's factories. Developed by Deloitte, this solution ensures real-time visibility into machine telemetry, accessible exclusively within Daikibo's intranet.

# Project Scope
**Main Features:**

**Private Dashboard:** Displays the health status of 9 telemetry-enabled machines in each of Daikibo's 4 factories.

**Intranet Access:** Access is restricted to Daikibo’s internal network/VPN.

**Seamless Authentication:** Synced with Daikibo’s internal authentication server; no additional account creation needed.

**Single Page Interface:** Lists the current status of all monitored devices on one page.

**Collapsible/Expandable Views:** Provides detailed status history at both factory and device levels.

# Design Mock-Up:
Refer to the wireframe image included in the project files for a visual reference. Note that this is a preliminary mock-up and not the final design.
